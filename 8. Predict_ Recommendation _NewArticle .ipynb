This isn't the kind of news that we've grown accustomed to. The kind that shares the stats about the gross underinvestment in female founders. No, our skin has already grown thick from repeated reminders of those cold facts. This was a new kind of news. The kind that was dirtier and darker than we'd wanted to imagine.A series of articles, filled with firsthand reports from female founders, has shone a black light on the stained sheets of Silicon Valley. We may have had our suspicions, but with the accounts from these brave women, the dirty laundry is finally being aired.Related 11 Grants for Women-Owned Businesses You Need to Know AboutIn case you missed it, the scandals kicked off with Justin Caldbeck. The co-founder of early stage investment fund Binary Capital was called out for inappropriately verbally and physically coming onto women entrepreneurs seeking funding from his firm. But, it didn't stop there. Then came the allegations against Dave McClure, the founder of 500 Startups. After reportedly making sexual advances toward at least one female founder, McClure resigned from his post, signing off, yep, I'm a creep. Perhaps the hardest revelation to bear was that these stories didn't stand in isolation. They are merely a sampling of the kind of inappropriate behavior that has existed in the Valley for years. Regrettably, behind these tales, stands a line of others ready to support the claims.Airing the truth has been a bold first step, and in large part, it's as far as we've been able to move forward thus far. Now the question on the table is, what happens next What are women to do to fight back against Silicon Valley's rampant sexism Are they to accept that male VCs are naughty by nature and that playing in their world comes at a price Are they expected to simultaneously fundraise and lead an activist campaign against chauvinism Or, are they expected not to fundraise at allNone of these options seems to be the answer. So, let's consider another. What if we're to remember that VCs are only empowered when they profit from a founder's fortune That being granted the opportunity to invest is a privilege that has to be earned. And what if female founders chose only to afford their opportunities to investors who valued their intellect, determination and performance What if those investors were only womenRelated This Entrepreneur Who Sold Her Business for $1 Billion Wants You to Throw Out the Unwritten Rules That Hold You BackAlongside the stats around the under-investment in women-led businesses are the equally sorrowing stats around the underrepresentation of women investors. So, it seems that we have a opportunity on our hands. Perhaps the misgivings of male VCs have opened the playing field to allow more females to step forward and take the lead. Women, now is your chance.If you're a founder, here are 50 female -friendly firms and funds who want to invest in your business. Seek them out and grant them the chance to be your champions. And for the women on the other side, you're called now, more than ever, to open your doors and your purse strings for these founders.Female-focused venture funds 1.
